##Project description :

- The aim of this project is to create a Smart Chat Bot in the context of eHealth applications. Smart
Chatbot is a mechanized chatbot that gets questions from its clients and attempts to comprehend
the inquiry, and give answers in like manner. It is done by converting the given sentence (which is
